# Awesome Agent Plugins

**A curated, verified directory of 33 Agent Plugins.** [Agent Plugins](https://agentplugins.codes/) is the
open, vendor-neutral standard published on 2026-08-06 by Amazon, Anysphere/Cursor, GitHub, Microsoft, OpenAI
and Vercel, with Google as a core maintainer. It bundles **Agent Skills and MCP servers** into one portable,
drop-in folder that every compliant client can read.

Every entry below is checked against a live `plugin.json` carrying the canonical 1.0.0 `$schema`. No link
dumps, no dead repos, and no per-client manifests dressed up as open-standard plugins. This is an unofficial,
community-maintained list and is not affiliated with the Agent Plugins Working Group.

## What is an Agent Plugin?

An **Agent Plugin** is a directory with a `plugin.json` manifest at its root. It's the packaging format the
Agent Plugins Working Group (Amazon, Cursor, GitHub, Microsoft, OpenAI, Vercel) published on 2026-08-06 to give
**Agent Skills** and **MCP server configs** one portable, install-once shape that every compliant client can
read — instead of writing a separate integration for each client.

```
plugin-name/
├── plugin.json               # REQUIRED — $schema + name. Optional: version, description,
│                              # license, keywords[], author, homepage, repository, extensions
├── skills/
│   └── <skill-name>/
│       ├── SKILL.md           # one skill per immediate child dir — NOT searched recursively
│       ├── scripts/
│       └── references/
├── mcp.json                   # OPTIONAL — mcpServers{}: stdio | streamable-http | sse
└── com.vendor.client/         # OPTIONAL — namespaced client-specific extensions
```

Minimal valid `plugin.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json",
  "name": "my-first-plugin"
}
```

**What the spec deliberately does *not* cover** — and this is the part worth being precise about, because it's
what most secondary write-ups blur: Agent Plugins is a **packaging format only**. It defines the manifest, the
fixed component locations, and two runtime variables (`${PLUGIN_ROOT}`, the package root; `${PLUGIN_DATA}`, a
persistent writable directory) that clients expand in `args`, `env` values and `cwd` — never in `command`, URLs,
or header keys. It has **no opinion on distribution, marketplaces, permissions, or how a client installs a
plugin** — each client (VS Code, Cursor, ChatGPT/Codex, GitHub Copilot, Kiro, and Google's tooling as core
maintainer) owns that layer itself. It also enforces real security boundaries: every path a plugin ships must
resolve inside the plugin root (symlink escapes are rejected), `command` in `mcp.json` is a single executable
token that is never shell-interpolated, and there's no portable field for embedding credentials.

## Quickstart: build your first Agent Plugin in 5 minutes

```bash
mkdir -p hello-plugin/skills/say-hello
cd hello-plugin

cat > plugin.json <<'EOF'
{
  "$schema": "https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json",
  "name": "hello-plugin",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "A minimal Agent Plugin — one skill, no MCP server.",
  "license": "MIT"
}
EOF

cat > skills/say-hello/SKILL.md <<'EOF'
---
name: say-hello
description: Greet the user by name and explain what this plugin does.
---

# Say Hello
1. Ask for the user's name if not already known.
2. Reply with a friendly greeting.
3. Mention that this plugin came from a `SKILL.md` file with zero extra config.
EOF

# Validate against the canonical schema before you ship it (see Tools below)
npx -y ajv-cli@5 validate --spec=draft2020 \
  -s https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json \
  -d plugin.json
```

Point a compliant client at the `hello-plugin/` folder (in VS Code: **Chat: Install Plugin From Source**) and
you have a working plugin — no `mcp.json` required, since it's optional. Add one when you actually need an MCP
server; see [`upstash/context7`](#the-catalog-verified-agent-plugins) below for a real `mcp.json` in production.

## Client support matrix: which clients support Agent Plugins

Verified against each vendor's own docs/announcement as of 2026-08-12. `✅` confirmed · `❓` not yet confirmed in
public docs — please open a PR with a source if you can confirm it.

| Client | Skills | MCP servers | Client extensions (`com.vendor.*`) | Install path |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **VS Code** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ ignored today ([docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/agent-customization/agent-plugins)) | `@agentPlugins` in Extensions view · **Chat: Install Plugin From Source** · auto-appears after install via Copilot CLI. Requires `chat.plugins.enabled`. |
| **GitHub Copilot** (VS Code, CLI, app) | ✅ | ✅ | ❓ | Shared install path with VS Code above; also via Copilot CLI. |
| **Codex / Codex CLI** | ✅ (discovers + reads plugin skills) | ✅ (opt-in MCP 2026-07-28 protocol, paginated discovery) | ❓ | Codex CLI workspace plugin install; marketplace details unconfirmed. |
| **ChatGPT** | ✅ (plugins can bundle skills) | ❓ | ❓ | Install UX not independently confirmed at time of writing — see [Codex Knowledge Base writeup](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/08/08/agent-plugins-1-0-open-standard-codex-cli-portable-skills-mcp-packaging/). |
| **Cursor** | ✅ | ✅ | ❓ | Listed as a launch client by Vercel's announcement; specific install flow not independently confirmed — PRs welcome. |
| **Kiro** | ✅ | ✅ | ❓ | Via "Kiro Powers" installable packages ([AWS Open Source Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/aws-supports-agent-plugins-an-open-standard-for-portable-agent-extensions/)). |

Google joined as a **core maintainer** on launch day (not a launch client) and is integrating support starting
with Agents CLI and the Data Agent Kit.

If you run one of the `❓` cells day to day, open a PR — a one-line source link is all we need to flip it to ✅.

## ⭐ Plugin of the Week

**[remotion](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/tree/main/packages/codex-plugin)** by
[Remotion](https://remotion.dev) — at 57,211 stars this is the largest project yet to ship a manifest carrying
the canonical `$schema`, and it is a useful signal precisely because Remotion is not an agent company. Video
rendering is one of the few tasks where an agent cannot check its own work by reading the output, so the
skills cover the parts that go wrong silently: frame-accurate timing, audio sync, caption placement and the
3D compositing API. Install: point a compliant client at `packages/codex-plugin` in the repo above.

Last week's pick, [sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-for-ai/tree/main/src/plugins/agent-plugin),
remains listed under DevOps.

*Rotates weekly. Nominate an entry by opening an issue with the `pick-of-the-week` label.*

## The catalog: verified Agent Plugins

> **Adoption reality check — remeasured 2026-08-24.** A week ago this section said adoption of the open
> manifest was near nil: of 34 vendor skill/MCP repositories scanned on 2026-08-17, only Sentry, Neon,
> Upstash's context7, Qdrant and the spec's own example carried the canonical
> `https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json` `$schema`. **That is no longer true, and this
> section was wrong for several days before this re-measurement caught it.**
>
> A GitHub code search for that exact `$schema` string in files named `plugin.json` now returns **2,204 files
> across roughly 140 distinct repositories**, including `huggingface/diffusers`, `remotion-dev/remotion`,
> `aws/agent-toolkit-for-aws`, `apache/magpie`, `BuilderIO/agent-native`, `inkeep/open-knowledge`,
> `SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling`, `CrowdStrike/fusion-skills`, `GitGuardian/agent-skills`,
> `vuetifyjs/mcp` and `perplexityai/modelcontextprotocol`.
>
> Two caveats that matter more than the headline. **The file count is not a repository count** — a handful of
> collections carry dozens of manifests each (`withoneai/one-agent-plugin` 83, `github/awesome-copilot` 68,
> `sickn33/agentic-awesome-skills` 34), so the distribution is far more concentrated than 2,204 suggests. And
> **per-client manifests have not gone away**: Vercel, Cloudflare, Stripe, Railway, MongoDB, Wix, Axiom and
> Chrome DevTools still ship `.claude-plugin/`, `.cursor-plugin/`, `.codex-plugin/` or `.grok-plugin/` folders
> rather than one portable `plugin.json`. What changed is that the open manifest stopped being a rounding error.
>
> **Spec 1.1.0 is in Working Draft** as of 2026-08-19 (`spec/1.1.0.md`, `schemas/1.1.0/`), introducing a second
> canonical schema URL at `https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.1.0/plugin.schema.json`. Adoption is early:
> 130 code hits against 3,760 for 1.0.0. Every entry in this catalog is verified against **1.0.0**, which is
> what the version badge reports. It will move to 1.1.0 when the catalog does, not before.
>
> Every entry in this catalog is checked for that `$schema`, which is why this list is shorter than a link dump
> would be. You can verify any entry yourself by opening its `plugin.json`. Know one we've missed? Please
> [open a PR](#-contributing).

## Agent Skills and MCP servers ready to be packaged as plugins

The Agent Plugins ecosystem is eleven days old at the time of writing, so most of the world's best Agent Skills
and MCP servers **aren't plugins yet** — they just need a `plugin.json` dropped on top. This section is not
the catalog above: nothing here has shipped a compliant manifest. It's a punch list of high-quality, real,
maintained skills/MCP servers that would make excellent plugins. Once one of these ships a `plugin.json`,
it graduates to the catalog above (via PR — see [Contributing](#-contributing)).

- [ahujasid/blender-mcp](https://github.com/ahujasid/blender-mcp) by [ahujasid](https://github.com/ahujasid) — control Blender 3D from any LLM. **[mcp]**
- [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) by [Anthropic](https://github.com/anthropics) — the official reference repo for the Agent Skills format that every plugin's `skills/` folder builds on. **[skills]**
- [browserbase/skills](https://github.com/browserbase/skills) by [Browserbase](https://github.com/browserbase) — official agent skills for driving a real browser via Stagehand; a second Browser & Automation plugin candidate. **[mcp]**
- [cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare) by [Cloudflare](https://github.com/cloudflare) — manage Cloudflare resources (Workers, KV, R2, DNS) from an agent. **[mcp]**
- [grafana/mcp-grafana](https://github.com/grafana/mcp-grafana) by [Grafana Labs](https://github.com/grafana) — query dashboards, alerts and datasources via MCP. **[mcp]**
- [microsoft/playwright-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) by [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) — Playwright-driven browser control MCP server. **[mcp]**
- [modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) by [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) — the official reference MCP server collection; the other half of most future plugins. **[mcp]**

*Sentry graduated out of this section on 2026-08-17 — `getsentry/sentry-for-ai` now ships a compliant
`plugin.json` and is listed in the catalog above. TranscriptAPI, Zillapi and StayingAPI graduated earlier.*

## Tools: validate and scaffold a plugin

- [`ajv-cli`](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-cli) against the canonical schemas — the validation one-liner multiple plugin authors in the catalog above ship in their own CI:
  ```bash
  npx -y ajv-cli@5 validate --spec=draft2020 \
    -s https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json -d plugin.json
  npx -y ajv-cli@5 validate --spec=draft2020 \
    -s https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/mcp.schema.json -d mcp.json
  ```
- [`eng/create-plugin.mjs`](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/eng/create-plugin.mjs) by GitHub — the scaffolder GitHub's own contributors use to generate new plugins inside `awesome-copilot`; a good reference for writing your own.

*This section is intentionally short. If you maintain a standalone Agent Plugins validator, linter, or
scaffolder, open a PR — it's an empty niche and first-mover here is real.*

Cursor is a launch client of this spec, but as of this writing Grok Bot's real plugin marketplace still runs on Cursor's own pre-existing `.cursor-plugin`/`.grok-plugin` manifest format, not this one — worth watching, not worth assuming.

## 🛡️ Security notice

This is a **curated list, not an audit**. Entries here are verified to have a real, schema-valid `plugin.json`
and a resolving repository at the time they were added — that is a packaging check, not a security review. The
spec itself enforces path containment and forbids shell-interpolated commands and embedded credentials, but a
plugin can still request an MCP server that talks to a service you don't trust, or a skill that gives bad
instructions. **Read a plugin before you install it**, the same as you would a package or a browser extension.
Report a plugin that misbehaves via [an issue](../../issues/new/choose) and we'll pull it pending review.
